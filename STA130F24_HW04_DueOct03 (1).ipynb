The data points may be dispersed over a large range of values if the standard deviation is high, or they may be concentrated near the mean if the standard deviation is low. A high standard deviation, for instance, shows that there is a large difference in the test results of the students, whereas a low standard deviation suggests that the majority of the students scored similarly.\n",

    "On the other hand, the standard error gives us an idea of how much the sample mean might change if we took repeated samples from the same population. It aids in our comprehension of how well the population mean is represented by our sample mean. The significance of standard error is especially noticeable when creating confidence intervals and performing hypothesis testing. In essence, standard error tells us about the accuracy of the mean we compute from the data, but standard deviation provides information about the variability of the data itself.\n",

    "Calculating the Uncertainty:Similar to how we would interpret standard error, the diversity in the bootstrap statistics enables us to evaluate the uncertainty surrounding our estimate of the vaccine's effectiveness.In summary We can efficiently test our hypothesis regarding the vaccine's impact while accounting for any possible data skewness by utilising bootstrapping. When the distribution of health scores is not normal or for small sample sizes, this method is especially reliable. We may also comprehend the unpredictability and dependability of our results better by seeing the bootstrap distribution visually."

    "\n",
    "Bootstrapping is a simple yet powerful method used to estimate the variability of a statistic, like the mean or median, without making strong assumptions about the population distribution. Here’s how it works in easy terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "How Bootstrapping Works:\n",
    "Start with a Sample:\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin with your original dataset, which represents a sample of data points from the population (e.g., health scores).\n",
    "Resample with Replacement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create many new samples by randomly picking data points from your original sample with replacement. Each new sample should be the same size as the original.\n",
    "Calculate the Statistic for Each Bootstrap Sample:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each bootstrap sample, calculate the statistic you're interested in (e.g., mean or median). Repeat this multiple times (often 1000 or more).\n",
    "Build a Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The collection of statistics from all the bootstrap samples forms a distribution of that statistic.\n",
    "Estimate Variability:\n",
    "\n",
    "From this distribution, you can estimate variability and construct confidence intervals. For a 95% confidence interval, take the 2.5th percentile as the lower bound and the 97.5th percentile as the upper bound.\n",
    "Why Use Bootstrapping?\n",
    "Bootstrapping is useful because it doesn’t rely on assumptions about the population’s distribution and works well with small samples. It provides a flexible, data-driven way to assess the uncertainty of your sample statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple Example:\n",
    "If you have a small sample of 10 test scores and want to estimate the average score for the population, bootstrapping allows you to create thousands of new samples from the original scores, compute the average for each, and determine the reliability of your average estimate."

On the basis of only using the techniques we've encountered in the course so far, it would only be possible to assess a null hypothesis of \"no effect\" if we had \"paired\" (e.g., \"before and after\") measurements in our data; but, we could of course assess a hypothesized parameter value estimated by the bootstrapped confidence interval of a relevant sample statistic...\n",

Compute the theoretical standard errors of the sample mean for the different variables you've considered; and, if they're different, confirm that they influence the (variance/uncertainty) bootstrapped sampling distribution of the mean as expected\n",
